NXP LPC18xx/43xx GPIO Pin Interrupt (PINT) controller

Required properties:

- compatible : should be "nxp,lpc1850-gpio-pint".
- reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
- interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller
- #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. The value shall be 2.
- interrupts : Must contain the interrupt numbers from the parent controller.
	       This defines the mapping between the controllers where the first
	       interrupt is mapped to pint hwirq 0 and so on. Which interrupts
	       that are connected to where and the number of is device specific.
	       For lpc1850 the mapping is 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 (8 in total).
- clocks: Must contain a reference to the functional clock.

Example:

pint: interrupt-controller@40087000 {
	compatible = "nxp,lpc1850-gpio-pint";
	reg = <0x40087000 0x1000>;
	interrupt-controller;
	#interrupt-cells = <2>;
	interrupts = <32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39>;
	clocks = <&ccu1 CLK_CPU_GPIO>;
};

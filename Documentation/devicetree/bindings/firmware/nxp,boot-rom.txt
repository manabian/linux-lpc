* NXP LPC boot ROM

NXP LPC microcontrollers contains a boot ROM used to retrieve part information
and access internal Flash memory and OTP memory. Note that the Flash API is not
available on Flashless devices. Availability of the Flash API can determined at
run-time by reading the 'CHIP ID' register in CREG.

Required properties:
- compatible: must contain the following: "nxp,lpc1850-boot-rom".
- reg: physical base address of the ROM and length of memory mapped region.
- syscon: handle to NXP CREG (Configuration Registers) syscon block.
- nvmem-cells: = handle to OTP memory cell which contain the part ID.
- nvmem-cell-names: must contain "PartID".

Example:
boot_rom: firmware@10400000 {
	compatible = "nxp,lpc1850-boot-rom";
	reg = <0x10400000 0x10000>;
	syscon = <&creg>;
	nvmem-cells = <&part_id>;
	nvmem-cell-names = "PartID";
};

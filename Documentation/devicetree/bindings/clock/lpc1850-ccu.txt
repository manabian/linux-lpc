* NXP LPC1850 Clock Control Unit (CCU)

Each CGU base clock has several clock branches which can be turned on
or off independently by the Clock Control Units CCU1 or CCU2. The
branch clocks are distributed between CCU1 and CCU2.

 - Above text taken from NXP LPC1850 User Manual.

This binding uses the common clock binding:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible:
	Should be "nxp,lpc1850-ccu"
- reg:
	Shall define the base and range of the address space
	containing clock control registers
- #clock-cells:
	Shall have value <1>.  The permitted clock-specifier values
	are the branch clock names defined in table below.
- clocks:
	Shall contain a list of phandles for the base clocks routed
	from the CGU to the specific CCU. See mapping of base clocks
	and CCU in table below.

Which brach clocks that are available on the CCU depends on the
specific LPC part.

Note that CLK_M3_x and CLK_M4_x have been renamed to CLK_CPU_x here
be more generic since both LPC18xx (M3) and LPC43xx (M4) are
supported.
